# Eclipse Lunar

Astro + Tailwind starter for SaaS and startup landing pages. Ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
so you can focus on crafting the experience.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the production site
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Lint the project with ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format files with Prettier

## Styling

TailwindCSS powers the design tokens, with global gradients and utility-first classes. Customize
`tailwind.config.mjs` to align with your brand. Design tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css`, and reusable
UI primitives (Button, Badge, Card, Container, Section) are available under `src/components/ui/` to keep
spacing, radii, and colors consistent across pages.
